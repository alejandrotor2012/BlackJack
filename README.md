# BlackJack
My take on designing a Black Jack game using python. The program is separated in modules, one containing the classes for the objects created on the main python script. This is packaged and provided as a zip file. Additionally, the loose .py files are attached as well for preview purposes  

Purpose of the project is to demonstrate OOP. Project idea supplied by Pierian Data Inc,via Udemy.com(Portilla, 'Completed Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3').
